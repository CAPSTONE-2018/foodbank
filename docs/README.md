## Background
The Northern Illinois Food Bank is a non-profit organization that engages the community in a commitment to feed our hungry neighbors. Across 13 counties, food manufacturers, local groceries, corporations, foundations, and individuals come together to donate food and funds, and evaluate and repack food for distribution to our more than 800 network partners – the food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and youth and senior feeding programs that serve more than 71,000 different people each week.

## Project Overview
The Northern Illinois Food Bank does compliance checks with local pantries. They are interested in simplifying the process with the help of a web-baed app that their compliance team would use when they go to each food pantry. The application will take an outdated process of filling out forms by hand and allow them to use a tablet. This would a useful because now instead of keeping track of physical forms that could be lost or destroyed, their data will now be safe in a database. There will be a convenience factor when they go back to look up data. Before they had paper files to look through to find information about a certain food pantry. With the help of this application, they will be able to look through a database to find records much more efficiently.

 The app will keep track of all of the important credentials about each panty, such as their location, director's name and tax verification. It will provide a convenient form to be filled out each time a pantry is monitored, and make note of the person that was spoken too. The application will combine the six pages into an interactive process.

 ## Current Status
 The project has been implemented using [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) with a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) database.  The application functions but it is awkward to use. The current version is running on [Heroku](https://murmuring-waters-64983.herokuapp.com) (ask me for credentials).  Updates to the project include
 * the ability to attach file and store them in the database
 * retrieval of data from the database
 * reports
